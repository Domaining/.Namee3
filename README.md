# Namee3

Namee3 is a blockchain domain name service that allows users to register and manage domain names on the Fantom blockchain. Namee3 domains are stored as NFTs, which means they are secure, immutable, and easily transferable.

**Namee3 domains offer a number of benefits over traditional domain names, including:**

* Security: Namee3 domains are stored on the Fantom blockchain, which is a secure and decentralized network. This makes them more secure than traditional domain names, which are stored on centralized DNS servers.
  
* Immutability: Namee3 domains are NFTs, which means they are immutable. This means that once a Namee3 domain is registered, it cannot be changed or deleted. This makes them a more reliable and permanent way to identify websites and applications.
  
* Transferability: Namee3 domains are easily transferable. This means that they can be bought, sold, or gifted to other users. This makes them a more flexible and liquid asset than traditional domain names.

If you are looking for a secure, immutable, and transferable way to identify your website or application, then Namee3 is a great option.

Here are some additional details about Namee3:

* Domain name extensions: Namee3 domains can be registered with a variety of domain name extensions, including .namee3, .fantom, and .ftm.
* Pricing: The price of a Namee3 domain depends on the length of the domain name and the domain name extension.
* Registration process: The registration process for a Namee3 domain is simple and easy to follow. You can register a Namee3 domain through the Namee3 website.
